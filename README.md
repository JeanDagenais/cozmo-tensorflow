# cozmo-tensorflow
Cozmo the Robot learns to recognize everyday objects using TensorFlow and FloydHub.

## Setup

Install the [Cozmo SDK](http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/)
```bash
virtualenv ~/.env/cozmo -p python3
source ~/.env/cozmo/bin/activate
git clone https://www.github.com/whatrocks/cozmo-tensorflow
cd cozmo-tensorflow
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Login to FloydHub CLI (sign up for a [free account here](https://www.floydhub.com/plans))
```bash
floyd login
```

## Using Cozmo to generate training data

Getting enough training data for a deep learning project is often a pain. But thankfully we have a robot who loves to run around and take photos, so let's just ask Cozmo to take pictures of something we want him to learn. Let's go with a can of delicious overpriced seltzer. Place Cozmo directly in front of a bottle of seltzer, and make sure that he has enough space to rotate around the can to take some pictures. Be sure to enter the name of the object that Cozmo is photographing when you run the `cozmo-paparazzi` script.
```bash
python3 cozmo-paparazzi.py seltzer
```

Repeat that step for as many images (categories) as you want Cozmo to learn! You should now see all your image categories as subdirectories within the `/data` folder.

### Uploading dataset to FloydHub

Let's upload our images to [FloydHub](https://www.floydhub.com/whatrocks/datasets/cozmo-images) as a FloydHub Dataset so that we can use them in our model training process.

```bash
cd data
floyd data init cozmo-images
floyd data upload
```

## Training our model

Make sure you are in our project's root directory, and then initialize a FloydHub project so that we can train our model on a fully-configured TensorFlow cloud GPU machine.
```bash
floyd init cozmo-tensorflow
```

Now we can kick off a training job. Couple things to note. First, we're going to mount the dataset that Cozmo created with the `--data` flag at the `/data` directory on our FloydHub machine. Second, I've edited this script to write its output to the `/output` directory (when running jobs on on FloydHub, you need to ensure that anything you want to save from a Job is stored within the `/output` directory). In our case, we'll be saving our retrained ImageNet model and the training labels to the `/output` folder.
```bash
floyd run \
  --gpu \
  --data whatrocks/datasets/cozmo-images:data \
  'python retrain.py --image_dir /data'
```

Once your job is complete, you'll be able to see your newly retrained model in [the job's output directory](https://www.floydhub.com/whatrocks/projects/cozmo-tensorflow/8/output). You can easily convert this output into a standalone FloydHub dataset to make it easier to mount in future jobs, which we'll need to do in order to use our trained model going forward.

## Testing our model on the cloud

We can test our newly retrained model by running another job on FloydHub that mounts (1) our trained model and (2) our images dataset, and uses the `label_image` script.
```bash
floyd run \
  --gpu \
  --data whatrocks/datasets/cozmo-imagenet:model \
  --data whatrocks/datasets/cozmo-images:data \
  'python label_image.py --graph=/model/output_graph.pb --image=/data/toothpaste/toothpaste-329.jpeg --labels=/model/output_labels.txt'
```

## Testing our model on Cozmo

Coming soon!
